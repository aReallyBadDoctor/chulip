extractImg.py
goes through each file and extracts images
from what i've observed, textures follow a header that describes their height and width,
so this script goes line by line looking for a known header and then creates the image out of them
images have pallettes of 16 colors that are located after the image

python3 extractImg.py source dest
run the script on all files and directories in source location and save all images to dest location

extractObj.py
goes through each file and extracts 3d models into .obj files
like textures, models follow a header that describes how many vertices there are.
the model's vertex positions, normals, and uv coordinates are then described.
the faces are formed between consecutive vertices, i.e. (1,2,3),(4,5,6)... etc.

python3 extractObj.py source dest
run the script on all files and directories in source location and save all models to dest location
